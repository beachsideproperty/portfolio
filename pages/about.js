            I made the decision to transition from molecular biology to coding
            last year. My background in research has given me a solid foundation
            for development--I love the thrill of solving new problems,
            exploring spaces where functionality meets design, and am eager to
            join a team where I can apply these skills in a way that brings
            forth positive change and joy.

            My work experience includes being a multi-functional researcher and
            purchaser at a biotech startup a molecular biology researcher at a
            UCSD lab, an undergraduate researcher and lab technician, Mojave
            desert field worker, and other various odd jobs in fashion and the
            service industry. In a team setting, I'm focused on balancing
            productivity with harmony.

            My all time favorite hobby is thrifting. On the left is a small
            collection of pieces I've found over the years. There are few things
            more thrilling to me than finding old treasures and giving them a
            new life!
