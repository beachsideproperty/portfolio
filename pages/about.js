          <p className='mb-4'>
            I made the decision to transition from molecular biology to coding
            last year. My background in research has given me an interest in,
            and foundation for, software engineering--I love the thrill of
            dissecting new problems, exploring the space where functionality
            meets design, and am eager to join a team where I can use these
            skills in a way that brings forth efficiency and high morale.

            My past work includes being a multi-functional researcher and
            purchaser at a biotech startup, a molecular biology researcher at a
            UCSD lab, an undergraduate researcher and lab technician, Mojave
            desert field worker, and various other jobs in fashion and the
            service industry.

            My all time favorite hobby is thrifting. There are few things more

            life!
