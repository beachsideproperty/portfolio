          <p className='mb-4'>
            I'm interested in exploring spaces where functionality meets design.
            My background in research science has given me a solid foundation
            for transitioning into software engineering--I love the thrill of
            solving new problems and am eager to join a team where I can apply
            my skills in a way that brings forth positive change and joy.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            My tech stack includes: Javascript, PostgreSQL, Express.js,
            React.js, Node.js, RESTful API Design/Implementation, Redux,
            Next.js, Git, GitHub, Agile Methodologies, HTML5, CSS, Material UI,
            Tailwind, Postico, Postman, Pixi.js, Vercel, and Render.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            My work experience includes being: a multi-functional researcher and
            purchaser at Heligenics, a biotech startup; a molecular biology
            research intern at Dr. Shaner's UCSD lab; an undergraduate
            researcher, field worker, and lab tech; and other various odd jobs
            over the years. In a team setting I'm focused on harmony and
            productivity, with an emphasis on maximizing morale.
          </p>
          <p className='mb-4'>
            My all time favorite hobby is thrifting. On the left is a small
            collection of pieces I've found over the years. There are few things
            more thrilling to me than finding old treasures and giving them a
            new life!
